* This doc explores areas related to wireless

# Definitions
1. WiFi
    1. A technology for radio wireless LAN of devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.
    2. Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing.
    3. Devices that can use Wi-Fi technologies include desktops and laptops, video game consoles, smartphones and tablets, smart TVs, digital audio players and modern printers.
        1. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via WLAN and a wireless access point.
    4. Wi-Fi most commonly use 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands and they are subdivided into multiple channels. Each channel can be time-shared by multiple networks.
        1. These wavelengths work best for line-of-sight. Most common materials absorb or reflect them, which further restricts range, but can tend to help minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments.
    5. Transmitter power
        1. Wi-Fi have higher power consumption compared to some other standards designed to support wireless personal area network applications. This makes battery life in some mobile devices a concern.
        2. Bluetooth provides a much shorter propagation range between 1 and 100m and so in general have a lower power consumption compared to Wi-Fi.
    6. Extended Service Set
        1. Formed for deploying multiple access points that are configured with the same SSID and security settings. Wi-Fi client devices will typically connect to the access point that can provide the strongest signal within that service set.
2. Bluetooth
    1. A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks. It's managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) which has more than 30,000 member companies in the areas of telecommunications, computing, networking, and consumer electronics.
    2. Operates at frequencies between 2402 and 2480 MHz including guard bands 2 MHz wide at the bottom end and 3.5 MHz wide at the top. It uses frequency-hopping spread spectrum.
        1. It divides transmitted data into packets, and transmits each packet on one of 79 designated Bluetooth channels.
        2. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1 MHz and usually performs 1600 hops per second with Adaptive Frequency Hopping.
    3. Bluetooth 4.0 + LE
        1. It includes Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth high speed and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocols.
    4. Bluetooth 5
        1. Designed for IoT included in iPhone 8 and iPhone X. It provides options that can double the speed at the expense of range, or up to fourfold the range at the expense of data rate, and eightfold the data broadcasting capacity of transmissions, by increasing the packet lengths.
    5. Design
        1. A layer protocol architecture consisting of core protocols, cable replacement protocols, telephony control protocols, and adopted protocols.
    6. Security
        1. Prior to Bluetooth v2.1, encryption is not required and can be turned off at any time. The encryption key is only good for approximately 23.5 hours and using a single encryption key longer than this time allows simple XOR attacks to retrieve the encryption key.
        2. In April 2017, security researchers at Armis discovered multiple exploits in the Bluetooth software in various platforms collectively called "BlueBorne" which allows attacker to connect to devices or systems without authentication and can give them "virtually full control over the device".
    7. Health
        1. It uses 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz range, microwave radio frequency spectrum, which is non-ionizing radiation, similar to one used by wireless mobile phones. Lower level than lowest-powered mobile phones.
    8. Implementation
        1. It implements confidentiality, authentication and key derivation with custom algorithms based on SAFER+ block cipher.
3. Radio control (RC)
    1. Use of radio signals to remotely control a device.
    2. Used for control of model vehicles from a handheld radio transmitter.
        1. Model vehicle - a model that is steerable with the use of radio control. All types of model vehicles have had RC systems installed in them, including cars, boats, planes, and even helicopters.
        2. Radio transmitter - an electronic device which produces radio waves with an antenna. It generates a radio frequency alternating current, which is applied to the antenna. When excited by this alternating current, the antenna radiates radio waves.
            1. Transmitters are necessary component parts of all electronic devices that communicate by radio, such as radio and tv broadcasting stations, cell phones, wireless computer networks, Bluetooth enabled devices, garage door openers, two-way radios in aircraft, ships, spacecraft, radar sets and navigational beacons.
        3. Terminology
            1. Transmitter is usually limited to equipment that generates radio waves for communication purposes, or radio-location, such as radar and navigational transmitters.
            2. Generators of radio waves for heating and industrial purposes such as microwave ovens. They are not called transmitter though similar circuits.
            3. Transceiver is a transmitter and receiver combined in one unit.
4. Radio Frequency (RF)
    1. An oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the frequency range from around twenty thousand times per second (20 kHz) to around three hundred billion times per second (300 GHz)
