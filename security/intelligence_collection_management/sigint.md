# Abstract
* This document explores areas of signal intelligence

## Definition
* The intelligence-gathering by interception of signals, whether communications between people(COMINT) or from electronic signals not directly used in communication (ELINT)
    * Signals are often encrypted, sigint involves the use of cryptanalysis to decipher the messages. It also involves traffic analysis to identify who is signaling whom and in what quantity

## Signal Detection
* Story
    * Even if a signal is human communication, the intelligence collection specialists have to know it exists.
        * If they learns that a country has a radar that operates in a certain frequency range, the first step is to use a sensitive receiver, with one or more antennas that listen in every direction, to find an area where such a radar is operating.
    * If operators know the probable frequencies of transmission of interest, they may use a set of receivers, preset o the frequencies of interest.

## Traffic Analysis
* Definition
    * When locations are known, usage patterns may emerge, from which inferences may be drawn.
    * Traffic analysis is the discipline of drawing patterns from information flow among a set of senders and receivers, whether those senders and receivers are designated by location determined through direction finding, by addressee and sender identifications in the message, or even MASINT techniques for "fingerprinting" transmitters or operators.

## Electronic order of battle
* Definition
    * Generating an electronic order of battle (EOB) requires identifying SIGINT emitters in an area of interest, determining their geographic location or range of mobility, charactering their signals, and, where possible, determining their role in the broader organizational order of battle.

## Communication Intelligence
* Definition
    * A subcategory of signals intelligence that engages in dealing with messages or voice information derived from the interception of foreign communications.
* It reveals
    * Who is transmitting.
    * Locations and moving direction.
    * Organizational function of the transmitter
    * The time and duration of transmission. Schedule if it's a periodic transmission
    * If the transmission is encrypted or not, and if it can be decrypted. If it is possible to intercept either an originally transmitted clear text or obtain it through cryptanalysis, the language of the communication and a translation.
    * The addresses, if the signal is not general broadcast and if addresses are retrievable from the message.

## Electronic signals intelligence.
* Definition
    * Intelligence-gathering by use of electronic sensors. Its primary focus lies on non-communication signals intelligence.
    * Performed by analyzing the collected parameters of a specific signal, and either matching it to known criteria, or recording it as a possible new emitter. ELINT data are usually highly classified, and are protected as such.
* Operation
    * The data gather are typically pertinent to the electronics of an opponent's defense network, especially the electronic parts such as radars, surface-to-air missile systems, aircraft, etc. It's used to detect ships and aircraft by their radar and other electromagnetic radiation.
