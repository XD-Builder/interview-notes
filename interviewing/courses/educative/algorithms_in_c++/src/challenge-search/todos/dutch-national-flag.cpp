// Problem Statement
// Implement a function that sorts an array of 0's, 1's and 2's. This is called the Dutch National Problem. Since the number 0 can be represented as the blue color, 1 as the white color, and 2 as the red color, we want the array to form the Dutch flag.

// Input
// An array of 0's, 1's and 2's.

// Output
// An array where the numbers 0, 1 and 2 are sorted.

// Sample Input

// arr = {2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0}
// Sample Output

// 0 0 0 1 1 2 2
