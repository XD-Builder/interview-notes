// Problem Statement
// Implement a function that takes two sorted arrays of variable length and finds the median of the two arrays.

// Input
// Two sorted arrays and their sizes

// Output
// The median of the two arrays

// Sample Input

// A = {100};
// B = {1, 5, 8, 10, 20}
// Sample Output

// 9
// Coding Exercise
// Take a close look and design a step-by-step algorithm before jumping on to implementation. This problem is designed for your practice, so try to solve it on your own first. If you get stuck, you can always refer to the hint and solution provided in the code tab. Good Luck!


double getMedian(int array1[], int array2[], int sizeOfArray1, int sizeOfArray2) {
  // Write your code here
  return -1;
