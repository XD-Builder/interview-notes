# Abstract

- This document lists topics that the course "Algorithms in C++: An Interview Refresher" is going to cover.

## Course Flow

1. Starting off with an introduction to major algorithmic paradigms and covering the basics of asymptotic analysis, we will work our way through 58 interactive coding challenges. Afterwards, there are detailed reviews of the various solutions.
2. Using data structures such as STL Classes, Linked Lists, Min-Heaps, and Graphs, we will solve some of the most interesting problems - the likes of which are known to be asked in technical interviews.

## Topics covered

1. Major algorithmic paradigms
2. Measuring time complexities of algorithms
3. Searching and sorting in different data structures
4. Graphs, graph traversals, and other important graph algorithms
5. Greedy Algorithms
6. The dynamic programming technique to efficiently solve problems
7. The divide and Conquer method, i.e. solving multiple subparts of a problem to solve the bigger problem
