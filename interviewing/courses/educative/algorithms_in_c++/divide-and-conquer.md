# Abstract
- This document introduces the Divide and Conquer technique of solving a problem using Binary Search in a sorted array

## Divide and Conquer Method
1. About
   1. Divide and conquer is **an algorithmic paradigm in which the problem is repeatedly divided into sub-problems until we reach a point where each problem is similar and atomic, i.e., canâ€™t be further divided**. At this point, we start **solving these atomic problems and combining (merging) the solutions together**. So, Divide and Conquer solutions have the following three steps:
      1. Divide
      2. Conquer
      3. Merge
