# FAQ
1. How many candidates will you be interviewing for the role?
    1. While we do not predetermine how many candidates we interview for a particular position, there may be other candidates interviewing the same day as you. However, we make hiring decisions solely based on your personal interview performance, and not how you compare to other candidates.
2. What do I need to bring to my interviews?
    1. The only thing you need to bring to your interview is a form of photo identification for badging. Our interviewers will already have a copy of your resume, but it doesn’t hurt to bring copies for your own reference. Scratch paper, writing utensils, and a calculator will be provided. It’s perfectly fine if you are more comfortable using your own calculator, but we do ask that candidates refrain from using smartphones to make calculations.
