# Abstract

- This document defines what you need to prepare for a TripleByte interview

## Interview Process

1. About
   1. A typical interview will last between 1 and 2 hours covering "programming", "system design", "debugging", and specialized knowledge(databases, algorithm, low-level systems, etc).
2. General
   1. Google Hangouts for interview
3. Coding
   1. Whatever programming language and environment you prefer.

## Programming

1. Goal
   1. Write a game in the console. Text-based (no graphics).
   2. Ensure you know how to read input from the console and write output to the console
2. Practice

   1. Questions in a range of technical topics are asked and discussed.
   2. Focuses are web systems, data structures and low-level systems.
      1. Tests breadth not depth
2. Read
   1. Advanced programming in the UNIX Environment
   2. The Algorithm Design Manual

## Working with an existing codebase
