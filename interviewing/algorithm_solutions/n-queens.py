# Given a chess board having N Ã— N cells, you need to place N queens on the board in such a way that no queen attacks any other queen.
# Input:
# The only line of input consists of a single integer denoting N.
# Output:
# If it is possible to place all the N queens in such a way that no queen attacks another queen, then print "YES" (without quotes) in first line,
# then print N lines having N integers. The integer in i t h line and j t h column will denote the cell ( i , j) of the board and should be 1
# if a queen is placed at ( i , j) otherwise 0. If there are more than way of placing queens print any of them. If it is not possible to
# place all N queens in the desired way, then print "NO" (without quotes).
